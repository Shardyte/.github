# Shardyte
Shardyte is an early-stage project exploring a **cross-game value and item system** designed to make progression, rewards, and ownership portable across different game servers and worlds.
The core idea is simple: allow players to earn value in one game environment and use it in another, while keeping **game servers in control** of how that value is created, traded, and applied in gameplay.
This organization exists to host ongoing development, experiments, and documentation as the project evolves.


## Why Shardyte Is Being Developed?
Many games and servers keep progression and value locked to a single world, which limits what players can carry forward and makes it difficult for server owners to build systems with lasting impact. Shardyte is being developed to explore whether value, ownership, and progression can exist beyond one server while still respecting each game’s rules and design. The idea is to give players a way to invest time and effort into things that can hold value across communities, while giving server owners new tools to reward engagement, experiment with economies, and add meaning to items, achievements, and participation. Without forcing a shared economy or taking control away from the servers themselves.

## Status
🚧 **Active Development / Early Exploration**
Shardyte is currently in active development.  
There is no public release or testnet available yet.
Code, tooling, and documentation will be added here over time as systems are built and refined.

Development progress for Shardyte is tracked publicly using a GitHub Project board that can be seen [here](https://github.com/orgs/Shardyte/projects/4).
> _Note: Some repositories and related work items are currently private.  
> As a result, not all issues or development details linked from the project board may be publicly viewable at this time._

## Direction
Shardyte is being designed with the following principles in mind:
- Game-first design, not blockchain-first
- Server-authoritative integrations
- Optional participation for games and communities
- Low-cost, scalable infrastructure
- Support for tokenized in-game items
The goal is to build shared systems that different games can adopt without being forced into a single economy or ruleset.

## About
All development is being conducted under **Decyubit LLC**.
> More details will be shared as development continues.
