# Shardyte

Shardyte is an early-stage project exploring a **cross-game value and item system** designed to make progression, rewards, and ownership portable across different game servers and worlds.

The core idea is simple: allow players to earn value in one game environment and use it in another, while keeping **game servers in control** of how that value is created, traded, and applied in gameplay.

This organization exists to host ongoing development, experiments, and documentation as the project evolves.

## Status

🚧 **Active Development / Early Exploration**

Shardyte is currently in active development.  
There is no public release or testnet available yet.

Code, tooling, and documentation will be added here over time as systems are built and refined.

---

## Direction

Shardyte is being designed with the following principles in mind:

- Game-first design, not blockchain-first
- Server-authoritative integrations
- Optional participation for games and communities
- Low-cost, scalable infrastructure
- Support for tokenized in-game items

The goal is to build shared systems that different games can adopt without being forced into a single economy or ruleset.

## About

All development is being conducted under **Decyubit LLC**.

More details will be shared as development continues.
